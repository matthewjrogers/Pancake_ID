# Pancake classification

This project was inspired by a recipe written on a scrap of paper labeled "probably pancakes". Being a data junkie, I couldn't resist building a model to predict whether or not the recipe actually yields pancakes (spoiler alert: it does - it's actually my favorite pancake recipe).

I built a data set from recipes listed on allrecipes.com, processed the data into a format suitable for machine learning, and trained a machine learning model to predict whether a recipe was pancakes or not pancakes.

I hosted the resulting model in a Shiny app. [The code is available on Github](https://github.com/matthewjrogers/pancake_prediction_app) and [a working app is available online](https://matthew-rogers.shinyapps.io/ProbablyPancakes).
